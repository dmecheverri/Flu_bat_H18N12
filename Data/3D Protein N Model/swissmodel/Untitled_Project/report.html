<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
The SWISS-MODEL template library (SMTL version 2024-04-17, PDB release 2024-04-12) was searched with 

 
 

 for evolutionary related structures matching the target sequence in Table T1. For details on the template search, see Materials and Methods. Overall 244 templates were found (Table T2).</p>

<h2>Materials and Methods</h2>



<h2>Template Search</h2>
<p>Template search with 
 
 
 has been performed against the SWISS-MODEL template library (SMTL, last update: 2024-04-17, last included PDB release: 2024-04-12).</p>



















<h2>Model Building</h2>
<p>
Models are built based on the target-template alignment using ProMod3 (<a href="#promod3">Studer et al.</a>). Coordinates which are conserved between the target and the template are copied from the template to the model. Insertions and deletions are remodelled using a fragment library. Side chains are then rebuilt. Finally, the geometry of the resulting model is regularized by using a force field.
</p>

<h2>Model Quality Estimation</h2>
<p>
The global and per-residue model quality has been assessed using the QMEAN scoring function (<a href="#qmean">Studer et al.</a>).
</p>

<h2>Ligand Modelling</h2>
<p>
Ligands present in the template structure are transferred by homology to the model when the following criteria are met: (a) The ligands are annotated as biologically relevant in the template library, (b) the ligand is in contact with the model, (c) the ligand is not clashing with the protein, (d) the residues in contact with the ligand are conserved between the target and the template. If any of these four criteria is not satisfied, a certain ligand will not be included in the model. The model summary includes information on why and which ligand has not been included.</p>

<h2>Oligomeric State Conservation</h2>
<p>
The quaternary structure annotation of the template is used to model the target sequence in its oligomeric form. The method (<a href="#qsqe">Bertoni et al.</a>) is based on a supervised machine learning algorithm, Support Vector Machines (SVM), which combines interface conservation, structural clustering, and other template features to provide a quaternary structure quality estimate (QSQE). The QSQE score is a number between 0 and 1, reflecting the expected accuracy of the interchain contacts for a model built based a given alignment and template. Higher numbers indicate higher reliability. This complements the GMQE score which estimates the accuracy of the tertiary structure of the resulting model.</p>
